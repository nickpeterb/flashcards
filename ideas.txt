DONE {
  Rewards guesses on the first try:
  if user gets question wrong --> nothing
  if user gets question right --> score += cards[currCard].level / round
}

Fatma's algorithm:
if user gets question wrong --> cards[currCard].level *= 2 -->Â cards[nextCard].level <= cards[currCard].level
if user gets question right --> cards[currCard].level /= 2 --> cards[nextCard].level >= cards[currCard].level


IDEAS
/* put off for now...
- Implement algorithm as described above -- make outline first
- Implement setting nextCard based on correct(or incorrect) answer(using .find())
*/

- Add 'scoreboard' on the side of page 

- Implement react router and create pages...
    - EndScreen (PlayAgain routes back to "/" , may need to re-get cards from db)
    - EditCards (Bootstrap InputGroup populated with each card, its level, and a delete button - as well as extra inputs to add cards

- Add support for multiple "decks" of flashcards
